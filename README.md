This project demonstrates simple and multiple linear regression using the **Housing Price Prediction Dataset**.
The goal is to predict house prices based on various features like location, size, number of rooms, etc.
WHAT I DID:
1.Imported the dataset from Kaggle (housing.csv).
2.Preprocessed the data:
Handled missing values using mean imputation.
Applied one-hot encoding to categorical variables.
3.Split the data into training and testing sets (80/20 split).
4.Trained a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.
5.Evaluated the model using:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R-squared Score (RÂ²)
6.Visualized results:
Created a scatter plot of actual vs predicted prices.
7.Interpreted model coefficients to identify the most influential features on house prices.
